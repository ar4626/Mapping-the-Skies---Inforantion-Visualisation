# Mapping The skies : Data Visualization of Indigo Airlines' Domestic Flight Routes at the Busiest Airports in India


## Project Overview<br />
This project aims to visualize the domestic flight routes of Indigo Airlines at the top 25 busiest airports in India where the airline operates. The data was collected from Indigo's official website and the visualization was created using Python libraries such as mpl_toolkits.basemap, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.animation, pandas, and numpy.
The visualization is designed to show the number of flights taking off in each hour of a day, which is divided into 24 slots of 1 hour each. A moving bar chart is used to represent the number of flights taking off in each hour, and the airlines flying in those time periods are also mapped using Python.
The project also uses the Flourish Studio platform to create the moving bar chart.

- Flourish Studio <br />

## Data Source<br />
The data was collected from Indigo's official website.<br />


## Results<br />
The project presents a data visualization that depicts the domestic flight routes of Indigo Airlines at the busiest 25 airports in India where the airline operates. The visualization uses a moving bar chart to showcase the number of flights taking off in each hour of a day, while also mapping the airlines flying in those time periods using Python. The primary objective of the visualization is to provide insights into the daily flight routes of Indigo Airlines between the top 25 busiest airports in India. By examining this data, the project aims to identify the most frequently served routes by Indigo Airlines and the airports most frequently used as departure and destination points. Additionally, the project seeks to comprehend the distribution of Indigo's flight routes across various regions of India and uncover any patterns or trends that may emerge from the data. The information provided can be valuable for Indigo Airlines in optimizing their flight schedules, improving their efficiency and profitability. It can also assist travellers in planning their journeys, selecting the most convenient airports, and scheduling their flights during the optimal time slots.<br />

The project's analysis can benefit Indigo Airlines by providing information to make informed decisions about their operations. This could include prioritizing certain routes, identifying areas where more flights may be needed, and reducing unnecessary costs. The data visualization can also help travellers plan their trips more effectively. By presenting a clear picture of the daily flight routes of Indigo Airlines, the visualization can help travellers identify the most frequently used airports and routes. This information can assist travellers in planning their trips, selecting the most convenient airports, and scheduling their flights during the optimal time slots. In conclusion, the project offers valuable insights into the domestic flight operations of Indigo Airlines and can be used as a reference for future analysis and optimization of flight schedules and routes.<br />

In summary, the data visualization created by the project aims to provide insights into the domestic flight routes of Indigo Airlines in India. The project presents the results using a moving bar chart and a map, providing a clear picture of the number of flights and airlines flying in different time periods. The project's objectives include identifying the most frequently served routes, airports, and understanding the distribution of flights across various regions in India. The information provided can help Indigo Airlines optimize their flight schedules and improve their overall efficiency and profitability. Additionally, the visualization can benefit travellers in planning their journeys and selecting the most convenient and cost-effective routes. Overall, the project offers a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the domestic flight operations of Indigo Airlines in India.<br />

## Future Improvements<br />
Some potential future improvements to this project include:<br />

--Including additional data sources: To enhance the analysis and insights, the project can incorporate additional data sources such as weather, passenger traffic, and flight delay information to identify the factors that influence the flight operations of Indigo Airlines.<br />

--Time-series analysis: The project can be extended to include time-series analysis to track the changes in flight operations over a period of time. This would allow for a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns in the data and help in predicting future trends.<br />

--Geographic analysis: The visualization can also be extended to include a geographic analysis of the flight routes, such as showing the busiest flight routes and airports on a map, or analyzing the regional trends in flight operations.<br />

--Social media analysis: The project can also leverage social media data to analyze the sentiment of customers towards the airline and use this information to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br />

--Integration with other platforms: To make the visualization more accessible and user-friendly, the project can be integrated with other platforms such as mobile applications or web portals to allow users to access the insights and analysis on-the-go.<br />

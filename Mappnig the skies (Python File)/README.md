# Mapping The skies : Data Visualization of Indigo Airlines' Domestic Flight Routes at the Busiest Airports in India


## Project Overview<br />
This project aims to visualize the domestic flight routes of Indigo Airlines at the top 25 busiest airports in India where the airline operates. The data was collected from Indigo's official website and the visualization was created using Python libraries such as mpl_toolkits.basemap, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.animation, pandas, and numpy.
The visualization is designed to show the number of flights taking off in each hour of a day, which is divided into 24 slots of 1 hour each. A moving bar chart is used to represent the number of flights taking off in each hour, and the airlines flying in those time periods are also mapped using Python.
The project also uses the Flourish Studio platform to create the moving bar chart.

## Technologies Used<br />
- Python 3.0+ <br />
- mpl_toolkits.basemap <br />
- matplotlib.pyplot <br />
- matplotlib.animation <br />
- pandas <br />
- numpy <br />
- Flourish Studio <br />

## Data Source<br />
The data was collected from Indigo's official website.<br />


## Results<br />
This project visualizes Indigo Airlines' domestic flight routes at the top 25 busiest airports in India. The moving bar chart displays the number of flights taking off in each hour, and airlines flying during those periods are also mapped. The objective is to identify the most frequently used routes and airports, the distribution of IndiGo's flight routes across different regions, and any emerging patterns or trends.<br />

This information can assist IndiGo in optimizing their flight schedules and improving their efficiency and profitability, while also aiding travellers in planning their journeys and choosing the most convenient and cost-effective routes.<br />

## Future Improvements<br />
Some potential future improvements to this project include:<br />

--Including additional data sources: To enhance the analysis and insights, the project can incorporate additional data sources such as weather, passenger traffic, and flight delay information to identify the factors that influence the flight operations of Indigo Airlines.<br />

--Time-series analysis: The project can be extended to include time-series analysis to track the changes in flight operations over a period of time. This would allow for a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns in the data and help in predicting future trends.<br />

--Geographic analysis: The visualization can also be extended to include a geographic analysis of the flight routes, such as showing the busiest flight routes and airports on a map, or analyzing the regional trends in flight operations.<br />

--Social media analysis: The project can also leverage social media data to analyze the sentiment of customers towards the airline and use this information to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br />

--Integration with other platforms: To make the visualization more accessible and user-friendly, the project can be integrated with other platforms such as mobile applications or web portals to allow users to access the insights and analysis on-the-go.<br />

# Mapping The skies : Data Visualization of Indigo Airlines Flight Routes in India


## Project Overview<br />
This project aims to visualize the domestic flight routes of Indigo Airlines at the top 25 busiest airports in India where the airline operates. The data was collected from Indigo's official website and the visualization was created using Python libraries such as mpl_toolkits.basemap, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.animation, pandas, and numpy.
The visualization is designed to show the number of flights taking off in each hour of a day, which is divided into 24 slots of 1 hour each. A moving bar chart is used to represent the number of flights taking off in each hour, and the airlines flying in those time periods are also mapped using Python.
The project also uses the Flourish Studio platform to create the moving bar chart.

## Technologies Used<br />
- Python 3.0+ <br />
- mpl_toolkits.basemap <br />
- matplotlib.pyplot <br />
- matplotlib.animation <br />
- pandas <br />
- numpy <br />
- Flourish Studio <br />

## Data Source<br />
The data was collected from Indigo's official website.<br />


## Results<br />
The results of the project can be seen in the form of a data visualization that shows the domestic flight routes of Indigo Airlines at the top 25 busiest airports in India where the airline operates. The moving bar chart shows the number of flights taking off in each hour of a day, and the airlines flying in those time periods are also mapped using Python.
The objective of this visualization is to provide insights into the daily flight routes of IndiGo airlines between the top 25 busiest airports in India. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify which routes are most frequently served by IndiGo airlines and which airports are most frequently used as departure and destination points. Additionally, we seek to understand the distribution of IndiGo's flight routes across different regions of India and identify any patterns or trends that may emerge from the data. This information can be useful for IndiGo airlines in optimizing their flight schedules and improving their overall efficiency and profitability. It can also help travellers in planning their journeys and selecting the most convenient and cost-effective routes.

## Future Improvements<br />
Some potential future improvements to this project include:<br />

- Adding more airlines to the visualization to show a comparison of flight routes.<br />
- Adding an interactive feature to the visualization that allows users to filter and sort the data according to their preferences.<br />
- Improving the design and layout of the visualization to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.<br />
